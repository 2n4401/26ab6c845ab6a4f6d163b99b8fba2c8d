The event was well-attended, and the feedback we received from the participants was quite positive. A deeper technical interaction and an exclusive focus on CdTe PV makes this a unique and useful annual event to develop and strengthen a close CdTe research community, clarify and define research needs, and identify new opportunities for collaborative research in CdTe PV.<br>In this spirit, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 6th Workshop, to be hosted at The University of Toledo Main Campus. Randy Ellingson has volunteered to be our local host for this year’s event, and Michael Heben is the Program Chair. The 6th workshop will again be structured in two parts:<br>1. Day 1: Presentation of research results. Every primary participating organization is strongly encouraged to participate and present results.<br>2. Day 2: A discussion on research directions structured around the main themes and challenges (front interface, absorber, etc.), to update the CdTe PV Technology Roadmap (available on the US-MAC website). Note that principal CdTe researchers will join the roadmapping activities, with more junior attendees instead joining facilities tours of UToledo’s PVIC, First Solar, and Toledo Solar.</div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32"id=day1><h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey">Thursday, Oct 20</h3>Agenda table here ...</div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32"id=day2><h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey">Friday, Oct 21</h3>Agenda table here ...</div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32"id=attend><h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey">Attend</h3><h4 style=color:#ff8c00>Recommended Hotel</h4><p style=width:80%>Hampton Inn and Suites, Toledo Westgate<br>3434 Secor Road<br>Toledo, OH 43606<br>phone: 419.214.5555<br><a href=https://www.hilton.com/en/hampton/ style=text-decoration:none>hampton.com</a><br>Workshop attendees wanting to stay at the Hampton Inn should call the hotel and ask for a reservation under the “University of Toledo CdTe Workshop”.
