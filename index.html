<p style="width:75%;">
Dear Colleagues,
<p style="width:75%;">
Last year we held our 5<sup>th</sup> CdTe workshop in conjunction with the II-VI Workshop in Chicago, IL. The event was well-attended, and the feedback we received from the participants was quite positive. A deeper technical interaction and an exclusive focus on CdTe PV makes this a unique and useful annual event to develop and strengthen a close CdTe research community, clarify and define research needs, and identify new opportunities for collaborative research in CdTe PV.
<p style="width:75%;">
In this spirit, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 6<sup>th</sup> Workshop, to be hosted at The University of Toledo Main Campus. Randy Ellingson (UT) has volunteered to be our local host for this year’s event, and Michael Heben (UT) is the Program Chair. Day 2 Roadmapping will be organized by Matt Reese (NREL) and Jim Sites (CSU). The 6<sup>th</sup> workshop will again be structured in two parts:
<ul style="width:75%">
<li>Day 1: Presentation of research results. Every primary participating organization is strongly encouraged to participate and present results.</li>
<li>Day 2: A discussion on research directions structured around the main themes and challenges (front interface, absorber, etc.), to update the CdTe PV Technology Roadmap (available on the US-MAC
website). Note that principal CdTe researchers will join the roadmapping activities, with more junior attendees instead joining facilities tours of UToledo’s PVIC, First Solar, and Toledo Solar.</li>
<li>More details on the agenda will follow.</li>
</ul>

<p style="width:75%;">
Looking forward to a great workshop!<br>
The US-MAC CdTe Workshop team
