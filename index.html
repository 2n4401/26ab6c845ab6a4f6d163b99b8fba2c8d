The eventwas well-attended, and the feedback we received from the participants was quite positive. A deeper technicalinteraction and an exclusive focus on CdTe PV makes this a unique and useful annual event to develop andstrengthen a close CdTe research community, clarify and define research needs, and identify new opportunitiesfor collaborative research in CdTe PV.<p style="width:75%;">In this spirit, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 6th Workshop, to be hosted at The University of Toledo MainCampus. Randy Ellingson (UT) has volunteered to be our local host for this year’s event, and Michael Heben (UT) is the Program Chair. Day 2 Roadmapping will be organized by Matt Reese (NREL) and Jim Sites (CSU). The 6thworkshop will again be structured in two parts:<ul style="width:75%"><li>Day 1: Presentation of research results. Every primary participating organization is strongly encouragedto participate and present results.</li><li>Day 2: A discussion on research directions structured around the main themes and challenges (frontinterface, absorber, etc.), to update the CdTe PV Technology Roadmap (available on the US-MACwebsite). Note that principal CdTe researchers will join the roadmapping activities, with more juniorattendees instead joining facilities tours of UToledo’s PVIC, First Solar, and Toledo Solar.</li><li>More details on the agenda will follow.</li></ul><p style="width:75%;">Looking forward to a great workshop!<br>The US-MAC CdTe Workshop team </div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="day1"> <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Thursday, Oct 20</h3> Comming soon. </div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="day2"> <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Friday, Oct 21</h3> Comming soon. </div><div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="attend"> <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Attend</h3> <h4 style="color:darkOrange">Recommended Hotel</h4>Hampton Inn and Suites, Toledo Westgate<br>3434 Secor Road<br>Toledo, OH 43606<br>phone: 419.214.5555<br><a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hampton/" style="text-decoration: none">hampton.com</a><br><p style="width:75%;">Workshop attendees wanting to stay at the Hampton Inn should call the hotel and ask for a reservation underthe “University of Toledo CdTe Workshop”.
