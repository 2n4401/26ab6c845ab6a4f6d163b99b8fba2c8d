<p style="width:80%;">
Dear Colleagues,<br>
Last year we held our 5th CdTe workshop in conjunction with the II-VI Workshop in Chicago, IL. The event
was well-attended, and the feedback we received from the participants was quite positive. A deeper technical
interaction and an exclusive focus on CdTe PV makes this a unique and useful annual event to develop and
strengthen a close CdTe research community, clarify and define research needs, and identify new opportunities
for collaborative research in CdTe PV.<br>In this spirit, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 6th Workshop, to be hosted at The University of Toledo Main Campus. Randy Ellingson has volunteered to be our local host for this year’s event, and Michael Heben is the Program Chair. The 6th workshop will again be structured in two parts:<br>
1. Day 1: Presentation of research results. Every primary participating organization is strongly encouraged
to participate and present results.<br>
2. Day 2: A discussion on research directions structured around the main themes and challenges (front
interface, absorber, etc.), to update the CdTe PV Technology Roadmap (available on the US-MAC
website). Note that principal CdTe researchers will join the roadmapping activities, with more junior
attendees instead joining facilities tours of UToledo’s PVIC, First Solar, and Toledo Solar.
